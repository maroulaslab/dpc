This code provides a demonstration of the signal classification using the dpc distance
described in the 2018 paper Signal classification with a point process distance on the
 space of persistence diagrams by Marchese and Maroulas.
 
This code requires the code dpc.R. As written the code assumes that the dpc.R file is
in the Downloads folder but this can be changed.

The values of c, p, and the Takens embedding number tau can all be changed at the
beginning of the code.
