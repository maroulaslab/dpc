# dpc Distance
This repository contains R codes for the dpc distance for persistence diagrams introduced
 by Marchese and Maroulas in the 2018 paper Signal classification with a point process 
 distance on the space of persistence diagrams. The file "dpc.R" computes the dpc distance
 between two persistence diagrams. The R code titled "signal.classification.R" 
 demonstrates signal classification using the dpc distance as described in the previously
 mentioned paper. The "signal.classification.R" file is a good place to get started.
 It was written by Andrew Marchese, Vasileios Maroulas, and Cassie Micucci. Please see
