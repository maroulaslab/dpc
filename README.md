# dpc Distance
This repository contains R codes for the dpc distance for persistence diagrams introduced by Marchese and Maroulas in the 2018 paper Signal classification with a point process distance on the space of persistence diagrams. It also includes another R code titled "signal.classification" to demonstrate signal classification using the dpc distance. It was written by Andrew Marchese, Vasileios Maroulas, and Cassie Micucci.
